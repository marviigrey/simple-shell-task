Task two:
Develop a shell script /home/bob/print-month-name.sh that accepts the number of a month as input and prints the name of the respective month. eg ./print-month-name.sh 1 should print January and ./print-month-name.sh 5 should print May. Also keep these in mind.


The script must accept a month number as a command line argument.

If a month number is not provided as command line argument, the script must exit with the message No month number given.

The script must not accept a value other than 1 to 12. If not the script must exit with the error Invalid month number given.
